These are my exercism projects. I wish I would have thought to have started this repository earlier so that I would have all the iterations from this initial commit, but alas it didn't work out that way. Perhaps I'll pull them off of exercism.io and commit them someday.

For now, as of this initial commit, I have been working on the JavaScript track of exercises. I am currently awaiting feedback on my anagram exercise and will submit changes to that until I feel it's time to move on or somebody gives me a "Looks great!" on the website. (Though with feedback slowing to almost a month before receiving a single nitpick lately, I'll likely just have to ok myself thru for now. But they're fun and short enough exercises for now to keep going it on my own and awaiting the slow feedback.)
